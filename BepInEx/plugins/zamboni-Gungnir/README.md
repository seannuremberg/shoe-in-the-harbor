## Brief

**Gungnir** is an enhancement suite for the in-game console! It provides a brand new aesthetic, helpful commands, and for other programmers who want to contribute, a very easy way to add new commands!

## Features

-   New color scheme for the console and all Gungnir-related output.
-   Popup hints to show you how to use the command you're typing, and highlight which parameter you're entering.
-   Console history scrolling, up to 1,000 lines.
-   Many new commands.
-   Chain multiple commands together (e.g., `/fly 1;/creative;/god`)
-   Create custom names for commands or sequences of commands with /alias.
-   Bind commands to any key, right from the console, with /bind.
-   Helpful terrain modification and restoration commands.
-   â€¦and more on the way!

Some of you may use or know of SkToolbox, and Gungnir is quite similar, but seeing as the author stated it is no longer maintained, I thought I'd start work on my own console instead. I will not be adding things such as the on-screen menu or enemy detection features, as I feel those are out of the scope of what this mod should be.
This mod is obviously incompatible with SkToolbox and anything that may do something similar.

## Commands

```
/alias <String name> <String[] commandText>
Create a shortcut or alternate name for a command, or sequence of commands.

/bind <String keyCode> <String[] commandText>

```

## Usage

Press F5 and type /help to get a nice overview of what commands you can run. Each command will give you a list of arguments that are expected, what type it should be, and if it is required or not.

For example, the help text for /give says: /give \<String itemName\> \[Number amount=1\] \[Player player=none\] \[Number level=1\]
This says that there are 4 possible arguments to this command, and 3 are optional.
Any argument surrounded by \[square brackets\] is **optional**, while anything in \<chevrons\> is **required**.
The value after the equals sign tells you what the default will be. Sometimes **none** will be shown if the default value can't be described well, but that should typically only show for Player name arguments. If a player argument defaults to none, it means it will choose you by default.

## Possible argument types

| Type      | Possible values                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| String    | Any text you want.                                                                                                                         |
| Number    | A whole number, no fractions or decimals allowed.                                                                                          |
| (+)Number | A positive whole number.                                                                                                                   |
| Decimal   | A number with as many decimal places as you'd like.                                                                                        |
| Boolean   | A true/false value. There are only four things you can type that mean true: "yes", "1", "on", and "true". Everything else counts as false. |
| Player    | The name of a player currently on the server.                                                                                              |

Any of these can also have square brackets on the end, like String[], which means that, starting from that parameter, everything you type from then on will be used as the argument.

## Command Chaining/Aliases and Binds

Commands can be stitched together to execute them all in one go.
To execute multiple commands in sequence, separate them with a semicolon. Example:

`/god;/ghost;/nostam;/nores;/fly true`

This feature pairs well with the /bind command, allowing you to make easy toggles or quick access to utilities. You will need to use quotes around the command being bound to avoid confusing the command chaining. Example:

`/bind k "/butcher;/removedrops 100"`

Similarly, when creating an alias, if you intend to create an alias that runs multiple commands, please be sure to surround your command set with double quotes like the above example.

It's hard to tell whether you want to run multiple commands, or whether your alias/bind is supposed to include the extra commands. Using double quotes lets the mod know you want it to take everything in the quotes as the argument value.

## To-Do

-   More commands.
-   Auto-run commands when joining a game.
-   Better auto-complete. The game's built-in autocomplete system is pretty bad, and only supports auto-complete on the first argument. I have a plan to extend it to work for every argument of a command, and show the command format as you're typing.
-   Framework to allow mods to register their commands with Gungnir instead of the base game.
-   Ability to select text in the console.
-   More customization options (color scheme selection, maybe? Font size control, etc.)

## Installation

This mod requires BepInEx, and is installed the same as any other BepInEx mod. Place it in your plugins folder.
Please make sure the version of BepInEx you install also includes Harmony. If it doesn't please install that as well.
